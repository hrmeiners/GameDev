# Rust Survivors

Rust Survivors is a project that is based off of the popular game Vampire Survivors developed by poncle. The Steam page for the game can be accessed by this link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/

This project aims to recreate the game in the Bevy game engine, with the code written in the Rust programming language. The original game has recently been ported to the Unity engine and is available on PC, iOS, Android, XBOX, and Nintendo Switch.
I am only aiming to have this project be played on PC as of 10/14/2023, my first week coding this project.

Mainly, this serves as a cool way to both learn game development in the ECS, entity component system, paradigm of coding and also as a way to broaden my Rust programming skills..

Towards the endgame of Vampire Survivors, there starts to be so many enemies and projectiles on screen that the game engine tends to lag when I play it on my iPad.
Thus, I thought that if I were going to code this game myself, I should do it in Rust, a high-performance language. Also, Rust is cool.
